# Oasis DNS

DNS blocking of social media domains on Tuesdays & Thursdays UTC.

DNS: `172.104.208.59`

Please follow the pattern and add addtional social media networks or domains to [named.conf.blacklist](https://github.com/gregology/oasis_dns/blob/master/named.conf.blacklist).

Also please reach out if you have experience with DNS over TLS as this is something I'm struggling to setup.
